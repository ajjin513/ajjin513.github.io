          <h1>Nyam<br></h1><h3>"Nyum!" is a personalized snack subscription service that goes beyond simply delivering snacks. Rooted in the concept of emotional connection, it uses custom surveys and an emotion-based recommendation system to analyze users' moods, stress levels, and preferences. By tagging snacks with emotional cues like "comfort" or "energy," the app helps users discover treats that not only satisfy cravings but also align with their emotional needs. Perfect for students, busy workers, and anyone seeking personalized comfort, "Nyum!" redefines snacking as a source of emotional support and satisfaction. The name, inspired by Korean onomatopoeia, captures the playful and delightful essence of snacking.
